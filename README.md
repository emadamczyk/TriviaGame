# TriviaGame

This game is designed using javascrip and jQuery to use dynamic htmal and a countdown timer in the form of a trivia game. The player has a fixed limited amount of time to complete the quiz. If the player does not complete the game in time, the game alerts "Time's Up!" and then displays the number of questions answered correctly, incorrectly, and unanswered. If the player answers all questions before time runs out, the player clicks the "Done" button and then the next page displays the number of questions answered correctly, incorrectly, and unanswered. Players are not allowed to select more than one answer per question. 

Users click the "Start" button to start the countdown timer and begin answering questions. 

In the more advanced version of this game, the game would only display one question per page with a countdown timer for each question. It also alerts the player if the question was answered correctly or incorrectly before advancing to the next question. A game summary of questions answered correctly, incorrectly, or left unanswered is displayed. They player then gets an option to play again.
